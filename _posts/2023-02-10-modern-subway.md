The New York City Subway has [28 Subway routes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_York_City_Subway_services) traversing [36 Subway lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_York_City_Subway_lines). While the MTA (the operator of the Subway) continues to engage in a variety of major and important modernization programs across the system, few transit observers would say that NYC has a single "truly modern" subway line. 

What does a modern subway line look like? There are many to choose from around the world, but an appropriate model for the NYC Subway would be [Paris MÃ©tro Line 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_M%C3%A9tro_Line_1). The reason for this is that Line 1 is about the same age as the Subway (Line 1 opened in 1900), and services the center of the city. To make a useful comparison with the Subway, it makes sense for us to look at a very old metro that was modernized rather than a relatively new metro that was constructed with modern technology from the beginning.
